# Leaf's Arcade

A collection of arcade-styled games recreated in Godot.

Some games are meant to be close to their original counterpart, others have the 
focus on the unique mechanics presented in them.


## About

Source code of a personal project I'm making in order to learn game development
in Godot. This project is separated in different Godot projects in different
folders, numbered in the order I made them.

I have plans to, somehow, create another Godot project that visually imitate
an emulator for these games. 


### Games Included
- Pong
- Duck Hunt
- Asteroids
- Fruit Ninja
- *More games may be added over time as development continues.*
