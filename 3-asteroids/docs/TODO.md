# To do

## Features
- Main Menu
- High score
- Aliens space ship ~~that floats in randomly changing directions~~ that shoots 
at random directions. Its shots will damage the player and asteroids, but the 
latter won't increase the score. They will increase the player score by 500 when
defeated by them

## Fixes
- Message: Condition "p_child->data.parent != this" is true.
	- Cause: Calling remove_child(...) with player in world.gd



## Refactors
*None*
